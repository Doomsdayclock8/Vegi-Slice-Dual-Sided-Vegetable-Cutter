# 🎯 Objectives

Design a safe, efficient, and user-friendly vegetable cutting device.

Introduce a dual-sided cutting feature to increase productivity.

Incorporate swappable blade design for versatility in cutting sizes and shapes.

Ensure compactness, durability, and cost-effectiveness for both household and commercial use.

# ⚙️ Key Features

Scotch Yoke Mechanism: Converts rotary motion into reciprocating cutting action.

Dual Cutting Chambers: Allows two vegetables to be cut at the same time.

Swappable Blades: Enables cutting in different shapes and sizes.

Compact & Portable: Designed for home kitchens, restaurants, and food chains.

Enhanced Safety: Reduces the risk of hand injuries compared to conventional cutters.

# 🛠️ Design & Analysis

Customer-Centric Design: Based on extensive surveys across homemakers, jobholders, students, and restauranteurs.

Quality Function Deployment (QFD): Integrated customer voice into engineering specifications.

Functional Decomposition: Systematically analyzed for modular design and maintainability.

Material Selection: Optimized using both qualitative and quantitative (weighted average) methods.

Structural Analysis (ANSYS): Verified strength, durability, and safety of critical components.

Cost & Sensitivity Analysis: Evaluated feasibility for mass production with break-even and sensitivity models.

# Vegi-Slice-Dual-Sided-Vegetable-Cutter
This repository Contains the contents of the project titled "VegiSlice: Dual Sided Vegetable Cutter" which has been developed as part of the Product Design II Sessional (IPE 318) at Bangladesh University of Engineering and Technology (BUET). This project emphasizes mechanical innovation, user-centered design, and manufacturability.
# üéØ Objectives

Design a safe, efficient, and user-friendly vegetable cutting device.

Introduce a dual-sided cutting feature to increase productivity.

Incorporate swappable blade design for versatility in cutting sizes and shapes.

Ensure compactness, durability, and cost-effectiveness for both household and commercial use.

# ‚öôÔ∏è Key Features

Scotch Yoke Mechanism: Converts rotary motion into reciprocating cutting action.

Dual Cutting Chambers: Allows two vegetables to be cut at the same time.

Swappable Blades: Enables cutting in different shapes and sizes.

Compact & Portable: Designed for home kitchens, restaurants, and food chains.

Enhanced Safety: Reduces the risk of hand injuries compared to conventional cutters.

# üõ†Ô∏è Design & Analysis

Customer-Centric Design: Based on extensive surveys across homemakers, jobholders, students, and restauranteurs.

Quality Function Deployment (QFD): Integrated customer voice into engineering specifications.

Functional Decomposition: Systematically analyzed for modular design and maintainability.

Material Selection: Optimized using both qualitative and quantitative (weighted average) methods.

Structural Analysis (ANSYS): Verified strength, durability, and safety of critical components.

Cost & Sensitivity Analysis: Evaluated feasibility for mass production with break-even and sensitivity models.
